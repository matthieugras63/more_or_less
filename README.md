# more_or_less

Here is a More or less game, coded in PHP. 
In this game, a random number is created and registered in a variable.
The user submit numbers, here between 0 and 100, and has a message returned depending on "it's more" or "it's less"
Once the user found the correct number, a "New game" button appear.

Try to find the correct number with the less movements you can !

With the .php file, you can fin a tutorial to create your own game, explicated step by step (in french only atm)
